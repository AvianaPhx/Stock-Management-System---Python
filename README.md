# Stock Management System | Python
Worked on implementing a laptop rental system with features like
file handling for data storage and manipulation. Throughout the project, Utilized 
and understand IDLE and IDE in Python, exploring their practical applications and
effectiveness. The main goal of the laptop rental system is to efficiently manage laptops,
keeping track of purchase and sale. The system dynamically updates the available
stock of laptops based on user interactions. The program utilizes file storage, allowing
laptops information to be retained even when the program is closed. 
However, working with different data structures from the file can be time-consuming. The project is
organized into separate files, each serving a specific function within the costume rental
system. The primary functions of the system include viewing available costumes,
renting costumes if they are in stock, and facilitating the return process. For customer
convenience, billing is generated after each rental transaction, enabling them to keep
track of their purchases. Similarly, another bill is produced upon returning the costume,
providing a record of any fines incurred.
